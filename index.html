<!-- 
Steps:
Set up the HTML
-	Create an id for the table to turn it green and wrapper it
-	Create an id for the dealers hand and the players hand
-	Create an id for each card in the dealers hand and the players hand
-	Assign a class to each card so they can be styled correctly
-	Assign a class of empty to each card 
o	Add a dashed border to this
o	We will remove the class when the card is assigned
-	Float the dealers hand cards left
-	Float the players hand cards left
-	Set the overflow to hidden on the players and dealers hand
-	Add some padding to the cards
-	Add a wrapper for the dealer total and player total
-	Add a div specifically for the total score for each
-	Set up the action buttons
o	Deal
o	Hit
o	Stand
Style
JavaScript
-	Set onclick for deal
o	Call deal function
o	Deal should call shuffleDeck and assign to deck
•	Create shuffleDeck that returns shuffled deck
•	Outer loop = suits
•	Inner Loop = cards
•	Shuffle by swapping 2 cards in the array
o	Set up players starting hand and dealers starting hand
o	Create placeCard function that 
•	takes 
•	The card
•	Who’s Turn
•	Slot it should be in
•	When called, it should change the div text and class
-	Set onlick for hit
o	Call placeCard and send the next card in the deck 
•	As incremented by global placeInDeck
o	Send player and the factored slot
•	Could also write a loop that would check for first open spot instead of sending the slot in function
o	Add card to players hand
o	Increment playerTotalCards and placeInDeck
o	calculateTotal
•	Takes hand
•	Update the total the player has
•	Set up a for loop to run through the hand
•	Drop the last char of each because it’s the suit
•	Add the card value to the total
•	If it’s over 21, call bust
•	Create busts
o	Check who
o	Change innerHTML of message
o	Now we need a reset()
•	Let’s put it at the top of deal
•	Reset all vars
•	Run a loop to clear out the displayed cards
-	Set onlick for stand
o	Do nothing for player
o	Run computerTurn
•	Check if the computer has 17 or more
•	Add a “who” to the param of calculate total
•	Run a while loop
•	Same procedure as player
•	Once we exit the loop, we know the dealer has at least 17
•	Call checkWin
o	Get win count
o	Get values of both hands 
•	Could do a global
o	Check if dealer busted (we know the player hans’t or they couldn’t be this far)
•	Call bust
•	Increment win count for player
o	Check who has more
•	If user 
•	display message
•	increment win for player
•	If dealer
•	display message
•	reduce win for player
•	if tie
•	display message
o	Add winCount to bust
